Hello, world!

\section{Introduction}

Before we introduce the Ramsey numbers, we must first define a few terms.

A \textit{graph} $G = (V, E)$ consists of a set of \textit{vertices} $V$ connected by a set of \textit{edges} $E$. For the purposes of this paper, we assume that the graphs are \textit{simple}: that is, every pair of vertices has at most one edge between them.

A graph is \textit{complete} when every pair of vertices are connected by an edge. For each positive integer $n$, the complete graph on $n$ vertices is denoted $K_n$.

An \textit{(edge-induced) subgraph} $G' \subseteq G$ is formed from a subset of the edges of $G$, along with the vertices incident to them. When a subgraph is complete, it is called a \textit{clique}.

An \textit{(edge) coloring} labels every edge of a graph by elements from a given set of colors. By tradition, we use the colors \textit{red} and \textit{blue}.

With these definitions, we can state Ramsey's theorem:

\begin{Theorem}[Ramsey's theorem] \label{ramseys_theorem}
    Let $s$ and $t$ be positive integers. Then for sufficiently large $n$, every red-blue edge coloring of $K_n$ either has a fully red clique of size $s$, or a fully blue clique of size $t$.
\end{Theorem}

\begin{Definition}[Ramsey numbers]
    Define $R(s,t)$ as the smallest $n$ such that the conclusion of \cref{ramseys_theorem} holds. This is the \textit{Ramsey number} of $(s,t)$.
\end{Definition}

\section{Probabilistic proofs}

\begin{Lemma} \label{binomial_bound}
    For all positive integers $n$ and $k$,
    \[ {n \choose k} \leq \frac{n^k}{2^{k-1}} \ . \]
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Expanding the definition of the binomial coefficient, we see that
    \[
        {n \choose k}
        = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}
        = \frac{n(n-1)\ldots(n-(k-1))}{k!}
        \leq \frac{n^k}{k!} \ .
    \]
    To complete the proof, we use the identity
    \[
        2^{k-1}
        = 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times \ldots \times 2
        \leq 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \ldots \times k
        = k!
    \]
    to conclude that
    \[
        {n \choose k} \leq \frac{n^k}{2^{k-1}} \ . \qedhere
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{Theorem}
    For all $k \geq 4$, the following lower bound holds for the Ramsey numbers:
    \[ R(k,k) \geq 2^{\frac k 2} \ . \]
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $k \geq 4$. Consider the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices, where $n < 2^{\frac k 2}$. Since every pair of vertices in this graph is connected by an edge, there must be $n \choose 2$ edges in total.

    Now, suppose that each edge is colored red or blue independently with probability $\frac 1 2$. As each of these $2^{n \choose 2}$ colorings is equally likely, the probability of choosing a particular coloring is $2^{-{n \choose 2}}$.

    Let $A$ be a subset of vertices of size $k$. The probability of the event $A_\red$ that all edges within $A$ are colored red is then $2^{-{k \choose 2}}$. Hence it follows that the probability $p_\red$ that \emph{some} $k$-set is colored all red is bounded by
    \[
        p_\red = \Pr(\bigcup_{\abs{A} = k} A_\red)
        \leq \sum_{\abs{A} = k} \Pr(A_\red)
        = {n \choose k} 2^{-{k \choose 2}} \ .
    \]

Now, applying \cref{binomial_bound}, we use the fact that $n < 2^{\frac k 2}$ to conclude that
    \[
        {n \choose k} 2^{-{k \choose 2}}
        \leq \frac{n^k}{2^{k-1}} 2^{-{k \choose 2}}
        < 2^{\frac{k^2}{2} - {k \choose 2} - k + 1}
        = 2^{-\frac k 2 + 1}
        \leq \frac 1 2 \ .
    \]

Hence $p_\red < \frac 1 2$, and by symmetry $p_\blue < \frac 1 2$ for the probability that some $k$ vertices have all edges between them colored blue. It follows that $p_\red + p_\blue < 1$, so there must exist a coloring with no red or blue $K_k$. This means that $K_n$ does not have the Ramsey property for $(k, k)$, and the Ramsey number $R(k,k) \geq 2^{\frac k 2}$.
\end{proof}
